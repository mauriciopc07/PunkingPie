  <ol type="A">
    <li>For the crust, process flour and salt in a food processor. Scatter butter over flour; pulse until mixture
      resembles cornmeal, 7–12 pulses. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Drizzle 3 tablespoons of water over flour mixture. Using a rubber spatula, mix the dough, pressing the dough
      together. <u><strong> If the dough doesn’t come together add water by tablespoon just until dough comes
          together.</strong></u></li>
    <br>
    <li>Form dough into a ball; wrap in plastic and flatten into a 4-inch disk. Refrigerate dough at least <u>30
        minutes.</u></li>
    <br>
    <li> flour a work surface. Unwrap dough and lightly dust with flour. If needed, let dough stand at room temperature
      until it gives slightly when pressed; <u>5–10 minutes.</u> Roll dough out into an ⅛-inch thick 13-inch round.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Fold dough in quarters; place corner in center of a 9-inch pie plate. Gently unfold dough to cover plate, using
      one hand to pick up edges of dough and an index finger to press dough into corners and up sides. Trim dough
      overhang to ½-inch then tuck edges under and crimp using thumbs and pointer fingers.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Refrigerate dough-lined pie plate for <u>20 minutes</u>. Prick bottom, sides and corners with a fork. Line dough
      with a piece of foil, pressing it to line the corners, sides, and cover the rim. Prick foil about a dozen places
      with a fork. Refrigerate shell for <u>1 hour.</u></li>
    <br>
    <li>Heat oven to <strong>400ºF</strong> with rack set in lowest position. Bake shell <u>15 minutes</u>, pressing
      down on foil with an oven mitt to flatten if it puffs. Remove foil and continue to bake shell just until it begins
      to color, about <u>10 minutes.</u></li>
    <br>
    <li>Meanwhile, process pumpkin, brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, salt and pepper in a food processor
      for 1 minute. Transfer pumpkin mixture to a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a sputtering simmer, cook,
      stirring constantly, until thick and shiny, about <u>5 minutes.</u></li>
    <br>
    <li>Whisk mayo and milk into pumpkin and bring to a low simmer; keep warm until the pie shell comes out of the oven.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li> Process eggs in food processor until foamy, about <u>5 seconds.</u> With processor running, slowly stream in
      half of the warm pumpkin mixture. Scrape down sides of bowl as needed, add remaining pumpkin and process 30
      seconds more.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Immediately pour warm filling into hot pie shell. (Pour any excess filling into pie after 5 minutes of baking.)
      Bake pie until filling is puffed, dry-looking, and center slightly wiggles when gently shaken, about <u>25
        minutes.</u> Transfer pie to a wire rack and cool completely.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Served with whipped cream.</li>
